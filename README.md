# Gesture Recognition
Gesture Recognition via Conv3D and via Conv2D+LSTM/GRU Deep Learning Models.

## Problem Statement
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

## Understanding the Dataset
The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use.

Note that all images in a particular video subfolder have the same dimensions but different videos may have different dimensions. Specifically, videos have two types of dimensions - either 360x360 or 120x160 (depending on the webcam used to record the videos). Hence, you will need to do some pre-processing to standardise the videos.

## Note
Update the path of dataset based upon your environment. We had to also disable eager execution otherwise training was slow on GPU.
